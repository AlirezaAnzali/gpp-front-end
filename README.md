# GymPlanPro

Think back to a time when you first started working out. Maybe you went to the gym and felt overwhelmed by all the equipment and unsure of what exercises to do. Or maybe you tried following a generic workout plan you found online, only to find that it didn't really work for your body type or fitness goals.

## GymPlanPro
My app takes in information from the user, such as their fitness goals and how often they want to work out, and uses that information to generate a personalized workout plan. This plan is tailored specifically to the user's needs and goals and includes exercises that will help them achieve their fitness objectives. The app makes it easy for users to get started with a workout routine that is customized to their individual needs, so they can focus on getting fit and seeing results.

This is a full stack react application project using React, React-Router, Node.js, Express, and APIs.

This repository contains the final product as it was submitted.
